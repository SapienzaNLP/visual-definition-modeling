# Visual Definition Modeling

This is the repo for the paper [Visual Definition Modeling:
Challenging Vision & Language Models to Define Words and Objects](https://www.aaai.org/AAAI22Papers/AAAI-11783.ScarliniB.pdf).

In the paper we introduce two new tasks to asses vision-and-language models capabilities of capture semantic information
of both words (given a visual context) and visual objects within an image (as exemplified in the picture above) 

In this repo we release the code to reproduce the experiments (src/) and the two datasets (data/) DEMETER (left-side of the image) and DIONYSUS (right side of the image).
